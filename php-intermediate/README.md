I completed this assignment before w3schools.com
updated their MySQL section of their PHP course.
When I returned to the site I became aware that
the content has changed as of 10/21/2014 18:34:50.

To test my suspicions I did some quick Javascript
on the page:

```
alert(document.lastModified)
```

Hopefully it is cool, I submit this assignment
from the old outdated content. If this is a
problem I can re-submit, but I don't want to
do any work that I don't have to.
